# Problem Set Version 3

# Problem 1: Mountain Peak

# A mountain list is defined as a list that has at least three elements, 
# where there exists some i with 0 < i < len(lst)-1 such that 
# lst[0] < lst[1] < ... lst[i-1] < lst[i] and lst[i] > lst[i+1] > ... > lst[len(lst)-1].

# Given such a mountain list lst as a parameter, write a function that finds and 
# returns the highest peak (the index i of the maximum element).

def peak_index_in_mountain_list(lst):
    pass


mountain_lst = [0,3,8,0]
peak = peak_index_in_mountain_list(mountain_lst)
print(peak)

# Example Output: 2

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 2: Build Inventory

# Write a function build_inventory() that takes in a list of product_names 
# and a corresponding list of product_prices as parameters. The function returns
# a dictionary representing the inventory of a small store. Each product name 
# in product_names should be a key in the dictionary and the corresponding 
# value should be the item price.

# product_names[i] should be paired with product_prices[i] in the dictionary 
# where 0 <= i <= len(product_names). You may assume that product_names 
# and product_prices are the same length.

def build_inventory(product_names, product_prices):
    pass


product_names = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
product_prices = [0.99, 0.50, 0.75]
print(build_inventory(product_names, product_prices))

# Example Output:
# {'Apple': 0.99, 'Banana': 0.5, 'Orange': 0.75}

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 3: Update or Warn

# Write a function update_or_warn() that takes in a dictionary records, 
# a key item, and a new value update_value as parameters. The function 
# updates the value of item in records with update_value if item exists. 
# If item does not exist, it should print "<item> not found!" and not 
# modify the dictionary.

def update_or_warn(records, item, update_value):
    pass


records = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3}
update_or_warn(records, "grape", 4)
# Print the input dictionary after running the function to check if it was modified
print(records) 
update_or_warn(records, "banana", 5)
print(records)

# Example Output:
# grape not found!
# {'apple': 1, 'banana': 2, 'orange': 3}
# {'apple': 1, 'banana': 5, 'orange': 3}

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 4: Attendance Rate

# Write a function attendance_rate() that takes in a dictionary attendance_list 
# as a parameter. The function maps student names to their attendance status 
# ("Present" or "Absent"), and returns the percentage of students who are present.

def attendance_rate(attendance_list):
	pass


attendance_list = {
    "Bluey": "Present", 
    "Bingo": "Absent", 
    "Snickers": "Present", 
    "Winton": "Absent"
}

print(attendance_rate(attendance_list))

# Example Output: 50.0

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 5: Average Book Ratings

# Write a function average_book_ratings(), that calculates the average rating for
# each book in a collection. The function takes one parameter: a dictionary book_ratings 
# where each key-value pair represents a book title and a list of its ratings, respectively. 
# Ratings are represented as floating-point numbers. The function should return a new 
# dictionary with book titles as keys and their average rating.

def average_book_ratings(book_ratings):
    pass


book_ratings = {
    "The Great Gatsby": [4.5, 3.0, 5.0],
    "To Kill a Mockingbird": [4.8, 5.0, 4.0, 4.9]
}

# Example Output:
# {
#     'The Great Gatsby': 4.166666666666667, 
#     'To Kill a Mockingbird': 4.675000000000001
# }

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 6: Odd Keys Even Values

# Write a function odd_keys_even_values() that takes in dictionary as a parameter, 
# a dictionary with integer keys and values. The function returns a list of 
# keys that are odd where their corresponding values are even.

def odd_keys_even_values(dictionary):
    pass


dictionary = {1: 2, 2: 6, 3: 5, 4: 4, 5: 8}
final_list = odd_keys_even_values(dictionary)
print(final_list)

# Example Output:
# [1, 5]

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 7: Best Team

# You're developing an analytics tool for a sports league. Your task is to write a 
# function named team_with_best_average_score() that returns the team with the highest 
# average score over a season.

# The function should accept a list of dictionaries named games as a parameter. 
# Each dictionary represents data from a game, including the "team_name", and 
# the "score" they achieved in that game. The function calculates the average 
# score for each team across all games and returns the team with the highest average score.

def team_with_best_average_score(games):
    pass

games = [
    {"team_name": "Lions",
     "score": 23
    },
    {"team_name": "Tigers", 
     "score": 30
    },
    {"team_name": "Lions", 
     "score": 27
    },
    {"team_name": "Bears", 
     "score": 20
    },
    {"team_name": "Tigers", 
     "score": 24
    },
    {"team_name": "Bears", 
     "score": 22
    }
]

print(team_with_best_average_score(games))

# Example Output: Tigers

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Problem 8: First Unique Items

# Write a function find_unique_items() that takes two lists list_a and list_b as parameters. 
# The function identifies unique items from the lists and returns a dictionary with the 
# items as keys and a boolean value as the value indicating whether the item is unique 
# to the first list (True) or not (False).

def find_unique_items(list_a, list_b):
    pass

list_a = ["apple", "banana", "carrot"]
list_b = ["apple", "banana", "date"]

# Example Output: {"carrot": True, "date": False}
